# IMPACT OF MINING ON CHLOROPHYLL LEVELS


## Overview

Mining can have negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystem. In this study, I analyzed bimonthly chlorophyll measurements of *Imaginaria Flora* to determine whether mining has had a discernable effect on the health of the plants based on their chlorophyll levels.


## Methodology

The research was conducted using R and recorded in an R Markdown, with the following analytical libraries:
- tidyr, dplyr and reshape2, for data cleaning and transformation
- ggplot2, for data visualisations
- tseries and forecast, for time series analysis and auto.arima() models


## Results

The ARIMA models, trained on chlorophyll levels associated with mining activity, were able to accurately forecasts chlorophyll levels before mining commenced. Consequently, the findings of this brief study did not reveal any significant impact of the mining activity on the health of plants in the area.
